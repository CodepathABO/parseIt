Signup button connects to parse to add data to the "SIMPLE" table.

It switches the button text from signup to login... just for fun
    
On login you are sent to your "account page" on signup you are sent
to a for m to fill in first name, last name, and blood type fields.
    
This writes to Parse database which then send you to your user account page
where your fields are displated.
    
The Flow: 
    1. View Controller (Signup/Log In)
    2. If sign up - SingerUserDataViewController (TYPO I KNOW)
    3. UserInfoViewController (Account page)
    4. Edit page
    
Basic. but gets the into in and out of parse. and updated.

Notes ---

Using Parse pod. We'll have to convert to workspace. we can discuss.
